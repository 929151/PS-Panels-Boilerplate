ExtendScript to CEP Communication
=========================

Demo of the CEP5 External Object use to make an HTML Panel listen for CSXSEvent emitted from JSX.
Work in Progress

## Issues
For some reason the messages aren't updated as soon as they arrive, but instead after the whole JSX routine is done.
In fact the first part of the message is the returned value from the routine, and not the first event payload.

## Installation
Please see the shared [installation instruction](../../README.md#installation).

## Changelog
**V1.0** July 2014.
