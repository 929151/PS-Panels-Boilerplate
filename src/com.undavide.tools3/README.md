You can:

1. Rename the panel's title (from the text-area below it).
2. Remove/Add tools, clicking either on the <span style="color:red">X</span> or the <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold">+</span> icon; Remove All and Add All buttons are provided.

Click the Gear icon to apply changes (which are permanent and will stick between sessions).

## Installation
Please see the shared [installation instruction](../../README.md#installation) (and don't forget the Debug flag!)

## Improvements
Lot of fun with Angular JS. This might be the base for other elements such as Script and Action Buttons.

## Issues
Some people (myself included) won't see the Panel's title updated as soon as they type in the text-area. As a workaround, add an extra white space and the cancel (backspace) it. This will trigger the correct binding.

## Changelog
Added 12 July 2014.
