As follows a list of all the content - please see each project's readme.

## Topcoat
**com.undavide.topcoat**

Boilerplate code for a Panel implementing [Topcoat CSS](http://www.topcoat.io). See the [Readme](com.undavide.topcoat/README.md) for more info.

## Photoshop Tools #1
**com.undavide.tools1**

A Panel containing all 65 Tools (Marquee, Brush... you name it). I've built it to shape up with Angular.js and as a first step as an Adobe Configurator replacement feature. See the [Readme](com.undavide.tools1/README.md).

## Photoshop Tools #2
**com.undavide.tools2**

Evolution (and replacement) of **#1** - uses Toggle Buttons and automatically picks the tool that is currently selected when the panel is first opened. See the [Readme](com.undavide.tools2/README.md).
